# Mad Libs Game in C 

A simple text-based **Mad Libs** style game written in C.

This project is part of my journey learning C programming from scratch.

##  What This Program Does
The program asks the user to enter:
- Adjectives
- A noun
- A verb (ending with *-ing*)

Then it creates a short story using the given inputs.

---

##  What I Practiced
- Using `fgets()` for safe user input
- Working with strings in C
- Removing newline characters (`\n`) from input
- Basic input/output logic
- Writing clean and readable code

---

##  How to Compile and Run

```bash
gcc madlibs.c -o madlibs
./madlibs
